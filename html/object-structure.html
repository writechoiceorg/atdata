            <p><strong>routing_type</strong> <small>string</small>
              <br />The IP Routing Type (IPRT) specifies how the connection is routed through the Internet
              and can be used to determine how close the user is to the public IP address. For example,
              a user connecting through a fixed connection is likely very close to the connection. A user
              connecting through a regional proxy is probably in the same country as the connection,
              whereas a user connecting through a satellite connection could be anywhere.
              <br /><b>IP Routing Types:</b>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>fixed</strong>: The user is connecting through a fixed-line connection, such as cable,
                DSL, T1, and fiber. The user is likely to be at or near the location assigned to the IP.</li>
              <li><strong>aol, aolpop, aoldialup, aolproxy</strong>: The user is part of the AOL network. AtData can
                identify the user country in most cases. However, establishing the user location below country is
                not possible.</li>
              <li><strong>pop</strong>: The user is dialing into a regional ISP (Internet Service Provider) and is
                likely to be near the IP location.</li>
              <li><strong>satellite</strong>: The user is connecting to the Internet through a consumer satellite or
                a backbone satellite provider, where no information about the terrestrial connection is available.
                The user can be anywhere within the beam pattern of the satellite, which can span a continent or
                more.</li>
              <li><strong>cache proxy</strong>: The user is using a proxy connection, either through an Internet
                accelerator or a content distribution service. It is possible the user is located in a different
                country from the IP location.</li>
              <li><strong>international proxy</strong>: The user is connecting through a proxy (not an anonymizer)
                that routes traffic from multiple countries. It is possible the user is located in a different
                country from the IP location.</li>
              <li><strong>regional proxy</strong>: The user is connecting through a proxy (not an anonymizer) that
                routes traffic from multiple states within a single country. It is possible the user is located in a
                different state from the IP location.</li>
              <li><strong>corp proxy</strong>: The user is connecting through a proxy (not an anonymizer) that
                routes traffic through edge nodes, or nexus points for traffic entering and exiting a corporate
                network.</li>
              <li><strong>mobile gateway</strong>: The user is using a gateway to connect mobile devices to the
                public Internet. Many mobile operators, especially in Europe, serve more than one country and
                backhaul traffic through centralized network hubs. Therefore, it is possible the user is located in
                a different country from the IP location.</li>

    <summary><strong>email_validation</strong> <small>object</small>
      <br />
      <p>AtData's industry-leading email validation service is used by retailers, data companies and marketing platforms
        to verify whether an address can receive email or not and whether mailing to that address will affect the
        sender's ability to deliver email messages into the inboxes of its customers. AtData email validation stops
        invalid, misspelled and fake emails as well as emails that put your email marketing program at risk, such as
        spam traps.
        <br />
        Email Validation has a different purpose than fraud prevention, but if an email address is flagged with an
        “invalid” status, it should be rejected. However, a validation status of “risky” indicates that the email
        presents risk to your email marketing program, not that it presents risk of fraud. Full documentation of our
        validation API, including multiple examples, is located at the <a href="/reference/examples">Examples</a> page
        of the docs.

            <ul>
              <li><b>valid</b>: The email address passed all checks and is safe to mail.</li>
              <li><b>invalid</b>: Do not mail. The email does not have proper syntax, the domain is dead or the mailbox
                doesn't exist.</li>
              <li><b>risky</b>: The email address is valid but it may cause delivery issues (e.g. spamtrap, honeypot or
                complainer). If you're having deliverability issues, don't send email to risky addresses.</li>
              <li><b>unverifiable</b>: The domain doesn't support a mailbox level check. Also known as an "accept all"
                or "catch all" domain. Expect some bounces from these addresses should you choose to mail them.</li>
              <li><b>unknown</b>: The syntax and the domain of the email are valid, but we could not confirm the mailbox
                in the time allowed. Messages to these addresses may see bounces. Repeating the query later may deliver
                a valid/invalid status.
